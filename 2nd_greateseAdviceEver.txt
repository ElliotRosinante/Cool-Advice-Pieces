To prevent your Human brain from forcing you to do the short term pleasurable 
addictive stuff that build up into bad habits very quickly and in order to prevent your Human brain from stopping
you from doing the important things which are not plesurable 
in the long term that really matter in the long term such as exercising, reading, meditating etc, do not give yourself any time
to think our else your brain will outsmart you. 

You have only 5 seconds to act. Don't think. Just do it.
