In order to prevent your brain from forcing you to do the short term pleasurable addicting stuff
that rather quickly develop into bad difficult to quit habits that only matter in the short term and have no long
term benefit. And in order to also prevent your brain from stopping you from doing the "short term unpleasurable but with long
term benefits kinda activities" , you shouldn't give your brain enough time to think. 
If not it will outsmart and convince you into doing what you know you aren't supposed to do and into neglecting what you aren't 
supposed to do.

 You have only 5 seconds to ACT. stop thinking and just do it. 
credit to Mel Robbins. The 5 second rule.
